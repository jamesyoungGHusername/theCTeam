  # Installation

  It can be downloaded from GitHub, and run using the terminal. Uses node.js, npm, Inquirer, FS, and Jest for unit tests.

  Jest isn't required to run the program, but if someone wants to contribute to the project or run the unit tests they'll need it.

  

  # Usage 

 This terminal based application asks the user for input regarding some team members, and then generates an HTML page to display that information. Upon running program by typing "node index.js" in the terminal while in the the folder, the user will be asked how many team members they intend to enter information for, then they're asked a series of questions, the exact questions depend on the role of the employee who's details are being entered. Once the user has entered information for all the team members, the program generates html for them and writes it to a file. The file can then be opened in whatever browser the user prefers, or used or modified in whatever way the user sees fit.
